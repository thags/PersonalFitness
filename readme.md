# Personal Fitness

Fitness is personal. There are many different training methods and regiments. I like to use a mixture of different methods, but most apps and trackers are developed for a single method. What if I want to program weight lifting, running, mobility, calisthetics, flexibility and track them all? This is the goal of personal fitness.

## Goals

- ~~Create your personal list of exercises. There will be no built in list of exercises, if you want to do pullups you can create that exercise.~~
- ~~Create workout routines from your list of exercises.~~
- Track workouts
- Plan workouts: Assign a workout to a day of the week.
- Track exercise history and records. PRs, volume, distance, reps, sets, etc.
- Track body measurements
- Automatic progressive overload option
- Export and import of exercises, workouts and history

## Projects

### Backend API

This is the starting point. I want to develop a backend API to make it easy to self host and implement different front ends. It will also give guidelines to what is needed if any projects are developed that use local device storage instead of this backend. This is how I see myself using the app long term, connecting the backend to a cloud DB to make sure my info is available and help prevent data loss.

## Frontends

I thought about using the following frontend frameworks.
- Blazor / Maui
- React
- Vue
- Angular

Ultimately I decided to use React. Mostly just to learn how it works, since it is widely used.
