# Persoal Fitness

Fitness is personal. There are many different training methods and regiments. I like to use a mixture of different methods, but most apps and trackers are developed for a single method. For example, weight lifting. What if I want to program weight lifting, running, mobility, calisthetics, flexibility and track them all? This is the goal of personal fitness.

## Goals

- Create your personal list of exercises. There will be no built in list of exercises, if you want to do pullups you can create that exercise simply.
- Create workout routines from your list of exercises.
- Plan workouts: Assign a workout to a day of the week.
- Track workouts
- Track exercise history and records. PRs, volume, distance, reps, sets, etc.
- Track body measurements
- Automatic progressive overload option with deloading
- Export and import of exercises, workouts and history
- Self hosted to keep data private.

## Projects

### Backend API

This is the starting point. I want to develop a backend API to make it easy to self host and implement different front ends. It will also give guidelines to what is needed if any projects are developed that use local device storage instead of this backend. This is how I see myself using the app long term, connecting the backend to a cloud DB to make sure my info is available and help prevent data loss.

## Frontends

Yet to be developed. Focusing on the backend currently. After the backend is mostly completed I will start on the frontend. Some technologies I have my eyes on are:

- Blazor / Maui
- React
- Vue
- Angular
